            <h4> UAFC HISTORY</h4>
            <p>
                In January 1912, while Pastor Brooke and his wife Edith serving the Lord and His people in Swansea,
                South
                Wales,
                as a Pastor of a Pentecostal Assembly,
                the call of God came upon him to leave homeland for service in South Africa. Although their lives were
                in
                the
                midst of many blessings from the Lord,
                in that souls were being saved, the sick healed and many baptised with the Holy Spirit. They were not
                disobedient
                to the heavenly vision,
                but with their two children left England and arrived in Johannesburg in 1912. During just over ten years
                of
                ministry, the Lord graciously blessed their
                labours and in that time a number of assemblies were established among the white and the black
                community.

                <h4>DOCTRINE</h4>
                <p>
                    We believe that God is the original creator of all things, Himself eternally existent, without
                    beginning
                    or
                    end
                    (Exodus3:14) He is Omnipotent (Mathew 19:26);
                    Omniscient (Psalm 147: 5) Omnipresent (Psalm 139: 3-10) and Holy (Leviticus 19:2) God is Spirit
                    (John
                    4:24)
                    and
                    no
                    mortal man has ever seen Him or can see Him (1Timothy 6:16).
                    We know Him through His Word in which He has revealed Himself and made Himself known to man. We
                    believe
                    that
                    all
                    Scripture as contained in the Old and New Testament is the complete
                    Word of God (2 Timothy 3: 16 & 17).Jesus Christ believed in and expounded “all the Scriptures “(Luke
                    24:
                    25 &
                    27).
                    We believe that there is one God Who exists in three Persons:
                    God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. Although the Father is God, the Son is God and
                    the
                    Holy
                    Spirit is God, yet the Son is not the Father,
                    the Holy Spirit is not the Father and the Son is not the Holy Spirit, each is a separate person.
